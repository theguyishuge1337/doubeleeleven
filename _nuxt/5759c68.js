The building has been designed to enhance the well-being of the studio’s employees and support the growth of the business, whilst also acting as a central hub facilitating regular meetups for games professionals in the region and beyond. Employees will be moving in this month, before an official opening later this year.</p><p>The cutting-edge facility marks a significant achievement in Double Eleven's journey. After 14 years in locations ranging from lofts to shared office spaces, the company will be the sole occupant of a seven-story, multi-purpose building designed to bring all the studio’s UK teams under one roof and support employee wellbeing.</p><p>Double Eleven’s fitout of the work spaces is the result of years of meticulous planning and execution, taking into consideration modern design principles and the need for staff to access top-tier technology in a supportive environment. Boho X provides plenty of break-out spaces incorporating natural elements, and new amenities, including  a classroom, an auditorium, a market hall providing healthy, subsidised food and a fully-equipped staff gym.</p><p>“We've experienced remarkable growth, expanding from just over 100 employees to nearly 400 within the past  three years, with the majority of our workforce based right here in the centre of Middlesbrough”, highlights Kimberley Turner, CFO of Double Eleven. “We’re proud to have been able to retain many of the local talents in the region and support their growth over the years.”</p><p>Mark South, the company’s COO, who has been overseeing the design, fit-out and transition to the new headquarters, explains: “Boho X is a remarkable addition to Teesside. It’s a testament to Andy Preston and Ben Houchen’s proactive leadership in creating an office to the high standard that local technology companies need to both recruit and retain highly skilled people locally, nationally and internationally. This building embodies the ambitious vision of the Tees Valley Combined Authority and Middlesbrough Council, who have demonstrated their commitment to elevating the region's office infrastructure by setting a new benchmark for excellence.</p><p>Starting from a new, empty shell allowed us to design and build our space from scratch, and transform it into something that exemplifies our continual investment in our people and our culture. We’ve combined our experiences in incredible offices all over the world with best practices for modern working environments in the context of hybrid working. This has resulted in a contemporary design that focuses on fresh air, a mix of well-lit and dark areas, open spaces, all featuring significant greenery, with a specific focus on healthy living and most importantly, building human connections.</p><p>To bring it all to life, we’ve looked holistically at the people and supporting services required for our new headquarters. As a result, we’ve decided to create new roles, and our own hospitality, cleaning and security teams, leveraging the strengths of our parent company, Pneuma Group, allowing us to have full ownership of our employee experience.</p><p>More than just wanting a great quality of working life for our people; our new headquarters aspires to be a vibrant hub for developers, students, and professionals in the region. As well as  providing  spaces to work and collaborate, it also houses a classroom and an auditorium. Infrastructure that will support our ambition to host industry events, educational programmes and relevant local initiatives as a force for good. Our move into and fit-out of Boho X represents a significant investment and underscores our commitment to becoming an integral part of the local landscape, driving positive change and fostering growth in Middlesbrough and the wider region.\"</p><p>The landmark Boho X development was supported with £21m in funding from the Tees Valley Mayor and Tees Valley Combined Authority. Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: “Double Eleven are a fantastic example of the innovative and forward-looking companies we want to support across Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool and which are providing the highly skilled, well-paid jobs our economy needs. We want these companies to be able to expand and attract the best talent, but to do that we need to have the right offices and developments. We are proud to have supported Boho X, which will continue to help the growth of Middlesbrough’s thriving community of digital and creative businesses.”</p>",open:!1},{slug:"tedx-newcastle-double-eleven",title:"TEDxNewcastle x Double Eleven",date:new Date("2022-11-09"),image:{src:"images/carousel-centre/tedx-newcastle-double-eleven.jpg"},body:'<p>We are delighted to be a joint Headline Sponsor for TEDxNewcastle 2022, taking place this Saturday, November 12th at The Sage, Gateshead.</p><p>TED is an annual event that brings together the world’s leading thinkers and doers to share ideas that matter in any discipline — technology, entertainment, design, science, humanities, business and development.</p><p>The talks at the conference, called TED Talks, are then made available to watch for free on TED.com.

Of all the awards out there, this is probably the single most important one to us and resonates with the main reason we started the company originally: to create an awesome place to work where employees could have a healthy work-life balance, an environment that allows them to spend time with their families and friends and thrive both in and out of the office.</p><p>The past 18 months or so have been challenging for everyone in both a professional and personal capacity. Our company has not only grown tremendously in this time, but everyone has been working from home which was definitely not the norm for most before March 2020. Despite the challenges that recent times have presented to us, everyone on the team has worked incredibly well and we’re so proud of each and every one of them for the resilience, patience and passion they’ve demonstrated throughout. Around 75% of the score for this award comes from anonymous employee feedback and given the physical distance and the fact that a lot of teams haven’t met many of the people they’re working with in person, you can never be sure whether the environment you work hard to create and maintain as a company carries over on digital platforms as well as it would have in the office. It’s great to know we’re still on the right path for our company and whilst the recognition is fantastic, we know that the work to grow this will carry on; it’s like a living being that needs to be nurtured to thrive.</p><p>We can’t wait to celebrate with everyone in person when it’s safe to do so and we’re excited to continue making Double Eleven a fantastic place to work!</p>",open:!1},{slug:"announcing-our-new-malaysia-office",title:"Announcing our new Malaysia office",date:new Date("2020-01-21"),image:{src:"images/carousel-centre/malaysia-office.jpg"},body:"<p>2019 was a busy year for Double Eleven with major project announcements and a big expansion of our Middlesbrough-based team. 2020 doesn’t look like it’s going to be any slower, especially with this new announcement!
